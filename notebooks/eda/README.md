## exploration.ipynb
- test out loading model checkpoints
- explore whats in the checkpoints
- load saved trajectories and explore data format
- plot obs vs time
    - distance to target
    - drawer position, velocity

## base_action_analysis.ipynb
- deeper plots and visualizations of trajectories
- aim to compare difference between models' actions

## output_comparison.ipynb
- use output of one model to get predictions in another, analyze
- actions, values
